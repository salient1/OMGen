<h1>README</h1>

<p>OMGen is a Java project for generating object mothers for classes that exist in the invoked classpath</p>

<p>Currently, there is only one OM style supported: DType.  This name isn't official; it's just a name that I've assigned to a
style of object mother that a friend of mine, Dion Stewart, came up with.  In the future, I will likely also provide built in
support for the MakeItEasy style of object mother.  Custom, user supplied, generators can also be used (courtesy of
command-line argument).</p>
